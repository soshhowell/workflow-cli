# Workflow CLI Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and enhancements for the Workflow CLI tool.

### Step Execution Enhancements
- [ ] **Working Directory Consistency**: Ensure commands execute in the same directory where the CLI tool is called from
- [ ] **Conditional Steps**: Add support for conditional execution based on memory state or previous step results
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Support running multiple steps in parallel when dependencies allow
- [ ] **Step Dependencies**: Define step dependencies and execution order
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Support for setting and using environment variables in steps

### Workflow Features
- [ ] **Workflow Templates**: Create reusable workflow templates with parameter substitution
- [x] **Nested Workflows**: Support calling other workflows from within a workflow
- [ ] **Workflow Validation**: Enhanced validation for workflow structure and dependencies

### CLI Improvements
- [ ] **Interactive Mode**: Interactive workflow execution with step-by-step confirmation
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode**: Preview workflow execution without running commands
- [ ] **Verbose Logging**: Configurable logging levels and detailed execution logs
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars and status indicators

### Output & Reporting
- [ ] **Structured Output**: JSON/YAML output format for programmatic consumption
- [ ] **Execution Reports**: Generate detailed execution reports with timing and results
- [ ] **Step Output Capture**: Save step outputs to files or variables

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Custom Success Handlers**: Plugin system for custom success validation logic
- [ ] **Workflow Scheduling**: Integration with cron or other scheduling systems
- [ ] **Remote Execution**: Execute workflows on remote systems

## Future Considerations ðŸ’­

### Integration & Extensibility
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Support for custom plugins and extensions
- [ ] **API Integration**: REST API endpoints for workflow management
- [ ] **Docker Support**: Containerized workflow execution
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and other CI/CD platform support

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Workflow Caching**: Cache step results for faster re-execution
- [ ] **Resource Management**: CPU and memory usage controls
- [ ] **Large Workflow Support**: Optimize for workflows with hundreds of steps

### User Experience
- [ ] **GUI Interface**: Web-based or desktop GUI for workflow creation and management
- [ ] **Workflow Marketplace**: Share and discover community workflows
- [ ] **Documentation Generator**: Auto-generate documentation from workflows
